 ### Election-Audit Summary:
Using Python script that was written for this purpose, the election-audit was proven to be successful in processing large amount of data. Using Python programming language and with a small change in our script (using different keys in the dictionary, updating the list and changing variables in step1. and step2.) we can perform the same analysis not only for  other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections.
